# Project Resilience
Project Resilience's platform for decision makers, data scientists and the public.

[Project Resilience](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/extcoop/ai-data-commons/Pages/project-resilience.aspx),
initiated under the Global Initiative on AI and Data Commons, is a collaborative effort
to build a public AI utility that could inform and help address global decision-augmentation challenges.

The project empowers a global community of innovators, thought leaders, and the public to enhance and use
a shared collection of data and AI tools, improving preparedness, intervention, and response to environmental,
health, information, or economic threats in our communities.
It also supports broader efforts toward achieving the [Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)](https://sdgs.un.org/).
