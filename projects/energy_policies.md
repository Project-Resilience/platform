## Decision makers

- Energy policy makers
- Climate change policy makers
- Government officials

## Objectives

To optimize energy policies to minimize temperature change, cost of energy, government spending, and reduction in energy demand.

## Interactive application

The user interface is available here: [Energy policies optimization](https://climatechange.evolution.ml/)

## Data attributes

### Context

A scenario like one of the five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways from the AR6 climate report,
or a custom scenario.

- Long-Term Economic Growth (GDP PPP)
- Near-Term Economic Growth (GDP PPP)
- Transition Time (years)
- Population (B)

### Actions

A set of energy policies to be implemented for:
- Coal
- Oil
- Natural Gas
- Renewables
- Bioenergy
- Nuclear
- Carbon Pricing and Energy Standards

See the 'Show Actions' button in the [interactive application](https://climatechange.evolution.ml/) for details.

### Outcomes

- Temperature change from 1850 (°C) (Minimize)
- Highest cost of energy (($/GJ)) (Minimize)
- Government spending (T$) (Minimize)
- Reduction in energy demand (EJ) (Minimize)

## Data

Decisions are evaluated using the [En-ROADS climate solutions simulator](https://www.climateinteractive.org/en-roads/).

## Code

TODO
