## Decision makers

<!-- List decision makers that could use this project-->
- Environmental organizations
- Shipping companies
- Ship captains
- Insurance companies

## Objectives

<!-- Describe the objectives of the project in one sentence -->
Reduce the number of whale strikes globally. 

## Deliverables

<!-- Provide links to the deliverables of the project -->
<!-- For instance, a link to the interactive application -->
- A dynamic risk map highlighting potential vessel–whale interaction zones across wide ocean regions, updated as environmental and traffic conditions change
- Dynamic, seasonal shipping routes that are optimized for reducing whale strikes
- Timely warnings and recommendations intended to support proactive mitigation actions such as speed reduction, course adjustment, or increased situational awareness in higher-risk areas.

The user interface could take the form of a web application or a mobile app.
If possible, the whale collision risk and avoidance recommendations could be
integrated into existing shipping management systems, used directly by planners.
Even better, it might be possible to integrate the recommendations into ship navigation systems, providing real-time guidance to captains and crews.

## Data attributes

### Context

<!-- Describe the situation decision makers are in when then have to make a decision -->
The situation decision makers are in when they have to make a decision can be described by the following attributes:

- Ship location
- Collision risk map
- Vessel traffic
- Current weather condition
  - Air temperature
  - Ocean temperature
  - Ocean currents
  - ...
- Season
- Whale spotting areas
- Krill spotting areas
- ...

### Actions

<!-- Describe what the decision makers can do achieve their objectives -->
Decision makers can take the following actions:

- Dynamically adjust global shipping routes
- Reduce speed when entering a high risk zone
- Adjust ship's course
- Increase situational awareness when entering a high risk zone

### Outcomes

<!-- Describe the metrics decision makers are trying to optimize, on which they are evaluated -->
Decision makers are evaluated on the following outcomes:

- Maximize crew safety
- Minimize whale strikes
- Minimize ship fuel consumption
- Minimize delays

## Data

<!-- Describe the data used to evaluate the decisions -->
Possible data sources:
-  [Vessel Traffic](https://hub.marinecadastre.gov/pages/vesseltraffic)
