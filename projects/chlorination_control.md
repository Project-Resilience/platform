# Water System Chlorination Optimization

<!-- Describe the project in one sentence, e.g. A project that... -->
This project focuses on evolving an agentic system that can reliably control the time-varying dynamics via chlorination injection in a water distribution system/network.

## Decision makers

<!-- List decision makers that could use this project-->
- Local and national government officials
- Civil/Environmental Engineers
- Public and Federal Health Institutions

## Objectives
<!-- Describe the objectives of the project in one sentence -->
To optimize the real-time chlorination levels in a water network to, therefore, minimize Cl bound violations, minimize amount of Cl injected, minimize infection risk, and maximize the fairness and smoothness of Cl injections at varying locations in the network.

## Deliverables

<!-- Provide links to the deliverables of the project -->
<!-- For instance, a link to the interactive application -->
A user interface and a thorough paper on arXiv are in progress.

## Data attributes

### Context

<!-- Describe the situation decision makers are in when then have to make a decision -->

- Pseudo, real-time Cl concentrations at varying points in the network
- Water flow measurements in certain pipes

### Actions

<!-- Describe what the decision makers can do achieve their objectives -->
Decision makers will control the amount of Cl injected at varying points in the network after assessing the context at each timestep.

### Outcomes

<!-- Describe the metrics decision makers are trying to optimize, on which they are evaluated -->
Decision makers are evaluated on multiple objectives/outcomes:

- Cl Bound Violations (Minimize)
- Total Cl Injected (Minimize)
- Infection Risk (Minimize)
- Fairness of Cl Injections; i.e. the similarity in magnitudes of Cl injected at different sites (Maximize)
- Smoothness of Cl Injections; i.e. the similarity in magnitudes of Cl injected at the same site across consecutive timesteps (Maximize)

## Data

<!-- Describe the data that is used to evaluate the decisions -->
The data was derived as part of the 1st AI for Drinking Water Chlorination Challenge at IJCAI 2025: [GitHub repo](https://github.com/WaterFutures/AI-for-Drinking-Water-Chlorination-Challenge-IJCAI-25)

The simulation itself is generated by the [EPyT-Control](https://pypi.org/project/epyt-control/) library

## Code

<!-- Point to the repo that contains the code -->
The in-development code for this project is available here: [Code](https://github.com/rivmons/aichlor-ijcai25/tree/main)

## Needs
<!-- What kind of help is currently needed for this project? -->

List of needs:
- Contacts with decision makers (how to weigh different objectives for use in real-world networks)
- UI/UX experts
- Compute
