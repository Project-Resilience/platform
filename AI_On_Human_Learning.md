### Tier 1

| Section                | Content                                                                                  |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Project Objective**  | Improve human learning and development through the utilization of AI in classrooms                                                             |
| **Current Practice**   | Human instructors, humans teaching humans                   |
| **Innovation**         | Using AI as a supplementary tool to teach humans. AI teaches cognitive functions while humans teach social functions                |
| **Stakeholders**       | Students, Instructors, Parents, Schools                                                                       |
| **Personas**           | Students, Instructors, Parents, Schools |
| **Risks**              | Humans exposed to AI may not learn as effectively as the well tested existing methods                                                                     |
| **Budget**             | Unknown                                                           |
| **Timeline**           | Unknown                                                               |
| **Data Safety**        | All information will be anyonymized. No PII will be collected |

### Tier 2

| Section                     | Content                                                                                  |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Scalable**                | If successful, this can be scaled to any/all schools with access to technology             |
| **Measurable**              | Students will be measured on their ability to perform cognitive tasks and their social skills. Cognitive tasks will weight accuracy above speed. Cognitive tasks will be represented through grades and NLP on essays. Critical thinking ability will be measured through essays. Social skills will be measured using SEL frameworks, self-report assessments, and the SSRS             |
| **Integratable**            | Many schools already provide technology to students. The integration would come in getting school boards on board with using the technology in their classrooms                        |
| **Repeatable**              | Can be repeated as long as school boards are willing to take on the challenge   |
| **Standardized**            | This should be standardized through a similar UI for each student to ensure a similar experience. The AI will judge success of the student through time it takes to answer and correctness of the answer and use that to move the student forward, weighting accuracy above speed.  |
| **Persona Needs and Goals** | It intends to help students learn more efficiently, allows instructors to focus on the human element of teaching, parents to have more successful students, and schools to have higher test scores               |
| **ISO Standard**            | ISO 21001, ISO 29994, and ISO 29991       |
| **Predictive Agent**        | A higher use of AI will result in a higher cognitive test score                |
| **Documentation**           | Pending |
| **Milestones**            | Pending                                                                                |

| **Team Structure** | Flat structure with a fluid hierarchy |
| **User Journey Mapping**  | Pending   |
| **Persona Feedback**      | Feedback will be gathered initially daily from students and then reduced to weekly intervals to ensure their learning needs come first                                                      |
| **Volunteer Intake**      | Informal. Contact Steven Birkinbine                                                                                  |
