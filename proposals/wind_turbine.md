# Project title

<!-- Describe the project in one sentence, e.g. A project that... -->
This project aims to develop an application that supports sustainable energy decisions by helping decision-makers compare various wind turbine models based on cost, energy production, and noise pollution to optimize clean energy adoption.

## Data attributes

### Context

<!-- Describe the situation decision makers are in when then have to make a decision -->
The situation decision makers are in when they have to make a decision can be described by the following attributes:

- **Average Wind Speed** (Numerical): Measured in meters per second
- **Proximity to Populated Areas** [Urban, Suburban, Rural]
- **Local Regulations** (Categorical): [Strict, Moderate, Lenient]
- **Land Area Available** (Numerical): Measured in square kilometers

### Actions

<!-- Describe what the decision makers can do achieve their objectives -->
Decision makers can take the following actions:

- **Selection of Wind Turbine Type** (Categorical): [Model 1, Model 2, â€¦, Model 20]  
- **Adjustment of Blade Length** (Numerical): Measured in meters  
- **Determination of Installation Location** (Categorical): [Near residential area, open farmland, coastal, mountain region] 

### Outcomes

<!-- Describe the metrics decision makers are trying to optimize, on which they are evaluated -->
Decision makers are evaluated on the following outcomes:

- **Energy Production** (Numerical): Measured in megawatt-hours **(Maximize)**
- **Total Cost** (Numerical): Includes purchase, installation, and maintenance **(Minimize)**  
- **Noise Pollution Impact** (Categorical): [Low, Medium, High] **(Minimize)**
