# Reduction of Global Food Waste

<!-- Describe the project in one sentence, e.g. A project that... -->
This project focuses on reducing global food waste by optimizing interventions across various stages of the food supply
chain, taking into account regional, economic, and waste management factors to enhance efficiency, raise consumer
awareness, and promote sustainable practices.
